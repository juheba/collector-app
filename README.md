# Flutter Collector App

This app uses Auth0 with Auth0 Flutter SDK. The setup is based on the official [Auth0 Flutter Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/flutter/interactive).

## Requirements
- Flutter 3+
- Android Studio 4+ (for Android)

## Setup & Configure Auth0 Guide

See [Auth0 Sample App README.md](./doc/Auth0_Sample_Readme.md)


# Getting started
* `dart run build_runner build`
* `dart pub global activate intl_utils` activates l10n utilities

## HELP?!
* Generate Hive Adapter Classes and Smartstruct Mapper with: `dart run build_runner build`
* To generate l10n files: `flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate`
* To generate collector-api, visit the collector-contract Repository.
